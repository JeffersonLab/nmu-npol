This code is being developed by the NMU collaborators for use by the Hall C GeN collaboration for background studies in Hall C.  The code used GEANT4 and is in the initial stages.  An older version exists in the branch called "retired".  This version, however, has reorganized the structure of the code so that it will be easier to modify in the future.  Included in the ease of use are individual classes for adding components to the simulation, new materials to the NpolMaterials list, and the use of a stepping action.
