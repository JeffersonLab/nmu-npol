%% issues.txt - used to track standing issues in the devlopment of Npol %%

Main issue ... for one second of 80 microAmp beam there is about 5x10^14 electrons.  To simulate 100x10^6 electrons takes 10 threads over 15 hours.  Yikes.  Need to find some optimizations.  
	
SteppingAction - set requirements for saving to ntuple (ParentID < 3, and certain particles (and maybe volumes)) Maybe kill tracks later.  Really need a plan for running with electrons on target and get distributions of particles on the front taggers (layer 1 and 2) so we can created a distribution function.  Then we can focus on just throwing those particles at the system from the target area and turn off other parts and particles.  

Check where the backround comes from.  If the beam dump, last section of downstream piple and hall shell contribute next to nothing then we can turn them off and increase speed significantly. 

Check Horizontal bender magnet of overlap problems.  It passes overlap check but there may be a problem.  May require tearing apart the GDML file we got from B.Waidyawansa SHMS code and reworking the variables a bit.

Same for the beam dump and beam dump pipe.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to me but it is low priority at this point as it doesn't add a lot to the background radiation. 
	
Mag Field for Horizontal Bender Magnet
	Use Geant4 built-in dipole fields for now (G4UniformMagField)

Multi-Threading
	Low priority
