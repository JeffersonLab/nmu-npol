%% issues.txt - used to track standing issues in the devlopment of Npol %%

Data Out - Ntuple
	Need to output:
		Volume Name
		Particle ID (refer to SHMS code)
		Parent ID
		Vertex Energy
		Hit position x,y,z
	each step or each event?
		Step level has the advantage of not having to run the sim again when analysis methods are changed
	
	SteppingAction - set requirements for saving to ntuple (ParentID < 3, and certain particles (and maybe volumes))
		Maybe kill tracks later

Geometry
	HBender (gdml) - place 4 volumes and not the "World" volume
	Dump (gdml) - fix
	Immediate Downstream Beamline (rings around one pipe section OR unions with pipe sections)
	Scattering Chamber (subtract solid pipe and add hollow stubs after)
		Change beamlines 
	Consider: GDML or constructor files?
