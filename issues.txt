%% issues.txt - used to track standing issues in the devlopment of Npol %%
	
Consider string Ntuple for volume names
	hashes?

Think of better name for NpolDataStructure

SteppingAction - set requirements for saving to ntuple (ParentID < 3, and certain particles (and maybe volumes))
		Maybe kill tracks later

Fix EDep histogram titles

Geometry
	In GDML parsing, find solution to repeating materials
		Use a materials.xml files ala example extended/persistency/gdml/G01/
		Or perhaps just rename the materials in the gdml files

	Immediate Downstream Beamline (rings around one pipe section OR unions with pipe sections)
		Split downstream Beamline extruded solid into two files

	Fix downstream beamline
	
Mag Fields
	Use Geant4 built-in dipole fields for now (G4UniformMagField)

Multi-Threading
	Low priority
