Update: Horizontal bender magnet: Checked the horizontal bender and narrowed the problem down to the HBcoil.  Namely, it has illegal operations when particles cross lines that two solids which are subtracted out of the coil in the GDML implementation are crossed.  This goes away when the coil is not included.  We are leaving out for now since background in the polarimeter is expected to be very small from the SHMS magnet but should be cleaned up in the future.

Update: Beam Dump: Currently we don't build or use the beam dump but if desired in the future it needs checked. Same for the beam dump and beam dump pipe.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to me but it is low priority at this point as it doesn't add a lot to the background radiation. 
	
Mag Field for Horizontal Bender Magnet  -- Currently NOT implemented.  Do we even need it?
	Use Geant4 built-in dipole fields for now (G4UniformMagField)

Multi-Threading
	VERY VERY Low priority
