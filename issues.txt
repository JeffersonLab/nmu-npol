%% issues.txt - used to track standing issues in the devlopment of Npol %%
	
Consider string Ntuple for volume names
	packing characters into doubles and saving into Ntuple double columns (4 columns = 32 chars max)

Think of better name for NpolDataStructure

SteppingAction - set requirements for saving to ntuple (ParentID < 3, and certain particles (and maybe volumes))
		Maybe kill tracks later

Fix EDep histogram titles

NTuple columns: add TrackID and Step number, px, py, pz
add particles: pi+, pi-, pi0

Output tests:
	Neutron (or proton) flux on polarimeter
	Full system - e- beam on target
		shield hut - all on, no floor but all walls, all on but no back wall, all off
		downstream beamline stuff - on/off
		beam dump - on/off
		magnets - on/off

Geometry
	In GDML parsing, find solution to repeating materials
		Use a materials.xml files ala example extended/persistency/gdml/G01/

	Immediate Downstream Beamline (rings around one pipe section OR unions with pipe sections)
		Split downstream Beamline extruded solid into two files

	Fix downstream beamline length
	
Mag Fields
	Use Geant4 built-in dipole fields for now (G4UniformMagField)

Multi-Threading
	Low priority
